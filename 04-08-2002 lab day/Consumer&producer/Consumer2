/*Q2)Write a Java program using Synchronized Threads, which demonstrates Producer Consumer concept.

Producer Consumer problem:
The producer-consumer problem is the classical concurrency of a multi process synchronization problem. 
It is also known as bound-buffer problem.

The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, who share a common, 
fixed-size buffer used as a queue. The producer generates a piece of data, put it into the buffer and starts again.
